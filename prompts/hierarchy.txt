You are analyzing a book text to identify its hierarchical structure. Your task is to identify the natural hierarchy present in the text itself (e.g., chapters, sections, subsections).

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Only identify hierarchy that is explicitly mentioned in the text (e.g., "Chapter 1", "Section 2.3", "Part III")
2. DO NOT use your knowledge about the book to hallucinate structure
3. DO NOT create hierarchy where none exists in the text
4. Look for clear markers like:
   - "Chapter", "CHAPTER", "Ch.", etc.
   - "Section", "Part", "Book", etc.
   - Numbered or titled divisions
   - Clear breaks with headings

Previous hierarchy context (if any):
{previous_hierarchy}

Text to analyze:
{text}

Return the hierarchy in the following JSON format:
{{
  "hierarchy": [
    {{
      "level": 1,
      "type": "chapter",
      "identifier": "1",
      "title": "Introduction",
      "start_position": 0,
      "end_position": 500
    }},
    {{
      "level": 2,
      "type": "section",
      "identifier": "1.1",
      "title": "Overview",
      "start_position": 100,
      "end_position": 300,
      "parent": "1"
    }}
  ],
  "has_more": true
}}

Note: 
- start_position and end_position are character positions in the current text chunk
- has_more indicates if there might be more hierarchy in subsequent chunks
- parent field links subsections to their parent sections
