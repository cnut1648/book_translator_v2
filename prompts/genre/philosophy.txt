Philosophy Translation Guidelines:

1. TERMINOLOGY PRECISION:
   - Maintain philosophical terms' technical meanings
   - When a term has multiple philosophical interpretations, choose based on context and school of thought
   - Preserve distinctions between similar concepts (e.g., "being" vs "existence", "essence" vs "substance")

2. CONCEPTUAL CLARITY:
   - Prioritize conceptual accuracy over literary elegance when they conflict
   - Maintain logical connections and argumentative structure
   - Preserve the rigor of philosophical reasoning

3. HISTORICAL CONTEXT:
   - Respect established translations of classical philosophical terms when appropriate
   - Consider the philosophical tradition the text belongs to
   - Maintain consistency with how key philosophers' concepts are traditionally rendered

4. ARGUMENTATION STRUCTURE:
   - Preserve logical connectors and transitional phrases
   - Maintain the flow of philosophical arguments
   - Keep premise-conclusion relationships clear

5. TECHNICAL EXPRESSIONS:
   - Translate philosophical jargon accurately
   - When terms are used in a specialized philosophical sense, prioritize that meaning
   - Add clarification in brackets [] only when absolutely necessary for comprehension

6. FOOTNOTES AND REFERENCES:
   - Maintain all citations and references
   - Preserve the academic apparatus of the text
